> ***Abstract:*** In recent times, microarray gene expression datasets have gained significant popularity due to their usefulness to identify different types of cancer directly through bio-markers. \hl{These datasets possess a high gene-to-sample ratio and high dimensionality, with only a few genes functioning as bio-markers. Consequently, a significant amount of data is redundant, and it is essential to filter out important genes carefully. In this paper, we propose the Simulated Annealing aided Genetic Algorithm (SAGA), a meta-heuristic approach to identify informative genes from high-dimensional datasets. SAGA utilizes a two-way mutation-based Simulated Annealing (SA) as well as Genetic Algorithm (GA) to ensure a good trade-off between exploitation and exploration of the search space, respectively. The naive version of GA often gets stuck in a local optimum and depends on the initial population, leading to premature convergence. To address this, we have blended a clustering-based population generation with SA to distribute the initial population of GA over the entire feature space. To further enhance the performance, we reduce the initial search space by a score-based filter approach called the Mutually Informed Correlation Coefficient (MICC). The proposed method is evaluated on 6 microarray and 6 omics datasets.} Comparison of SAGA with contemporary algorithms has shown that SAGA performs much better than its peers.
